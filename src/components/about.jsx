            <p> 
                This little project turned out to be quite the challenge!<br/>
                Took me a while to get filtering and sorting right,<br/> 
                but the biggest challenge was definately routing with React.<br/>
                It just wouldnt work, and then all of a sudden it did work!?<br/>
                And it did so while trying something I'd already tried before.<br/>
                So I got it working, but for now routing in React feels very fickle, whimsical.<br/>
                But that of course means I need to study and play with it a lot more.<br/>
